              One of my main hobbies is tweaking and maintaining Ubuntu on my
              laptop and desktop, which is a great way for me to learn more about how Linux
              works. I enjoy customizing my workflow for efficiency, using a
              tiling window manager (i3) and a taskbar (polybar). The dotfiles
              for these are on my <a href="https://github.com/cohenchris/dotfiles">GitHub</a>.

          <p>
              I have written numerous bash scripts to automate some mundane
              tasks, and heavily customized my .vimrc and .bashrc. I currently use  
              <a href="https://yadm.io/">YADM</a> (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager) to 
              keep track of all of my dotfiles. With such a heavily customized workflow,
              It makes it easy to transition between computers when needed. It even
              features a bootstrapping script that takes a fresh install of Linux and 
              changes the settings to exactly what I want them to, an exact copy of my
              normal workstation.

              This month-long project covered an absurd amount of content.
              We were tasked to create what is essentially a bash clone. The
              lexical analysis was done using <strong>flex and bison</strong>,
              where I tokenized certain inputs using regular expressions,
              executing different code based on what was inputted.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>File redirection</strong> was one of the first things
              that I tackled, so I learned all about juggling file descriptors
              to do so. <strong>Piping</strong> was a bit different than file
              descriptors - we had to use the pipe() system call and
              read/write to/from the pipe to communicate between different
              parts of the command.
          </p>
          <p>
              The next section covered{" "}
              <strong>signals and signal handling</strong>. Specifically, we
              set up handlers for ctrl-C (terminate command), ctrl-R (search
              command history), and SIGCHLD (zombie process elimination).
          </p>
          <p>
              One of the most challenging parts of this project was
              implementing <strong>subshells</strong>. For this, we had to
              fork a new process, and use two different pipes to communicate
              with it in order to get the output of the desired command. This
              proved difficult to debug because of the fact that two processes
              were being run.
          </p>
          <p>
              We also used regular expressions and directory browsing to
              implement <strong>wildcarding</strong>. We handled wildcarding
              for '*' and '?'.
          </p>
          <p>
              One smaller part of this project was{" "}
              <strong>decoding raw input</strong>, rather than canonical
              input. I was able to allow the user to type as they normally
              would with bash. Specifically, I handled left arrow, right
              arrow, delete (and ctrl-D), backspace (and ctrl-H), home (and
              ctrl-A), and end (and ctrl-E).
          </p>
          <p>
              The last part of this project was to implement{" "}
              <strong>command history and ctrl-R searching</strong>. Command
              history was pretty straightforward, and I ended up imitating
              bash's ctrl-R searching mode.

              During my 2019-2020 Winter break, I decided to teach myself
              C++, and challenge myself with a project that I had no idea
              how to start. The full source code of this project can be found 
              on <a href="https://github.com/cohenchris/sudoku_solver">GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
              I bought a sudoku book and began completing puzzles to get a
              good idea of how these puzzles could be solved algorithmically
              with as little guessing as possible - I ended up implementing
              5 different algorithms, which helped me complete around 40-50%
              of boards that I threw at it. The challenge, though, was the
              rest of the boards
          </p>
          <p>
              To finish everything else off, I implemented a recursive
              brute force algorithm. Basically, the idea was, when the
              program got stuck, solve a random Cell with a random
              candidate, then go on as usual. If the program got stuck
              again, it would recurse again, choosing another random value
              for another random Cell. If there were any unsolved Cells with
              no candidates, that brute force attempt failed, and another
              random candidate from the original Cell was chosen. If all
              candidates from that Cell failed, the board is unsolvable.

    /* Kernel Scheduling */
    fullTitle:
      "Kernel Instrumentation and Completely Fair Scheduling in XINU OS",
    title: "Completely Fair Scheduling",
    subtitle: "",
    categories: ["linux", "school"],
    desc: "A scheduling algorithm that attempts to efficiently juggle CPU and I/O bound processes based on typical behavior.",
    body: `<p>
              The ideology behind this algorithm, currently used in Linux as of 2007, is relatively simple.
              CPU-bound processes need the CPU as much as possible, so that they can finish
              any needed calculations as quickly as they can. However, I/O-bound processes are not
              bottle necked by the CPU, but rather, the user. Therefore, whenever an I/O-bound process is running,
              we should context-switch it out until it's ready. When it's finally ready, it's immediately given
              control of the CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
              Since, in this case, priority of a process clearly changes throughout its lifetime, we cannot use
              XINU's default static priorities. A new field for each process is created, which increases in parallel
              to the time that it's been running. This makes it easy to balance all CPU-bound processes and make sure
              they get equal control of the CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
              First, on creation of a process, it is created a priority value equal to the lowest priority value
              in the ready list. This helps make sure that a newly created process doesn't starve any existing processes.
              Just completing this simple step already makes sure that every process in the queue gets equal share of
              the CPU, without starving any other process. This means that CPU-bound process scheduling is complete.
          </p>
          <p>
              Secondly, we need to handle I/O-bound processes. There are many cases when a process would be I/O-bound,
              but for simplicity in this lab, we were instructed to only handle the case of a sleeping process.
              When a process is put to sleep, it is taken out of the ready list, so we don't have to worry about anything
              there. However, when the process is woken up, it is given a priority value equal to the maximum priority
              in the ready list. This makes it so that a woken process immediately gets the CPU. Setting the priority
              value equal to the max in the list, rather than the max total, makes sure that it doesn't starve other
              processes.

    desc: "Implementation of a responsive callback function using  ways for processes to communicate and return-oriented programming.",
    body: `<p>
              This lab was used as both illustration for how callback functions work, and training for return-oriented programming.
              IPC (inter-process communication) is used for a process to signal another process, which would then execute the callback
              function once the receiver is running.
          </p>
          <p>
              The sender process first puts a message into the receiver's inbox. It will stay there until the receiver has been
              context-switched back in. Once that happens, the receiver checks the inbox. If there is a message, return-oriented
              programming is used to manipulate the stack. The address of the callback function overwrites the original return address,
              and the original return address is moved down one space. This cases the callback function to first be executed, then the
              original place in the receiver's code.
          </p
          <p>
              This is not the most responsive way to implement a callback function, but there are advantages with this method.
              XINU is meant to be run on a single-core machine, and on a relatively weak back end. If we simply ran the callback
              function immediately when a receiver receives a message, the overhead involved in doing so could slow down execution
              significantly. XINU's single-core approach means that only one process holds the CPU at a given time, so there's no
              advantage in doing it that way in the first place, since the sender can never send a message while the receiver runs.

              Realizing that I lacked experience in cyber security, I decided to 
              take the plunge with a large personal project. A honeypot is a term 
              used in cyber security describing a network entity that purposefully 
              lures attackers away from some more important part of a network. Among 
              other functionalities, I decided to implement this. The full project proposal, 
              source code, and final analysis/report can be found on 
              my <a href="https://github.com/cohenchris/webserver_honeypot">GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
              I began by creating a robust, legitimate-looking HTTP web server. The
              final product implemented 14 different response codes, and support for 10 
              different file types. There is also full-fledged graphical directory browsing,
              starting at the 'server_root' folder.
          </p>
          <p>
              Each request made to the server is stored in a local MySQL database, recording the
              number of the request, time requested, source IP, source port, and hostname if the 
              IP is known. This logging proved to be extremely useful for later analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
              Parsing the server logs, I wrote a blacklisting program that would automatically ban
              any IP that attempted to connect 10 or more times in 3 seconds, and returned a specialized
              HTTP response code to the client. This helped decrease any excess load on the honeypot.
          </p>
          <p>
              I temporarily mapped the subdomain 'webserver.chriscohen.dev' to the IP of the server that was
              running the honeypot. In just a few days, I got hundreds of requests. The full analysis and breakdown
              of the requests can be read in its GitHub repository, linked above. If you'd like to test it for yourself,
              an interactive script is available that installs all dependencies, sets up the local MySQL server to log,
              and creates a script that starts the server that serves the IP of your choosing.

              The inspiration for this website began after working on the front
              end of 'Twistter', another project listed on the page. Twistter
              was rushed, so I really enjoyed being able to take my time to
              make the site how I wanted. I decided to buy a custom domain, too,
              since it was only $12 per year!
          </p>
          <p>
              I primarily use this website as a learning platform, keeping myself
              loosely up-to-date on current practices. When I started, <strong>ReactJS hooks</strong>
              were just introduced, so I targeted that. When hooks are needed, they are
              used in favor in classes throughout the source code, located on
              <a href="https://github.com/cohenchris/cohen_website">GitHub</a>.
          <p>
          <p>
              For deployment, the website is compiled into an efficient build-ready state
              using the command 'npm run build.' From there, I automatically pull down
              the latest version of my resume and deploy it to my Nginx web server.
              More information on Nginx in the next tile.

          <p>
            For this project, I forked <a href="https://github.com/GittyMac/WalletCount">WalletCount</a>.
            I wanted a simple budgeting app that suited my needs. Personally, I give myself a set budget
            each week. If I go over the budget for the week, the next week's budget is lessened. If I
            stay under, the available funds are carried over for the next week. This project was the
            closest to what I wanted (a minimalist, slim budgeting app). The core functionality had to
            be changed for my purposes, though, so I set out to do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you set your weekly spending budget to $100, $100 would be added to your
            available funds. Every time that you make a purchase, you subtract that
            amount from your available funds. Every Sunday, another $100 would be added into
            your available funds.
          </p>
          <p>          
            The intent of this app is to help the user keep track of their "fun-money", or money left
            over after all necessary expenses have been paid. My philosophy is that, once you
            have paid all fixed expenses, the money left over should be completely guilt-free.
            To encourage this view, past purchases are purposefully omitted. I designed this for
            my purposes specifically, but I hope that somebody else will find it useful!

          <p>
            For our senior project, myself and 5 friends decided to make a privacy-conscious, automated way to analyze your
            digital footprint. We pulled inspiration from websites like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktr.ee</a> and 
            <a href="https://campsite.bio/">campsite.bio</a>. The Github repositories are located <a href="https://github.com/TRACE-Digital/">here</a>.
            Please note that currently, new users are not allowed. We are keeping the website up for resume purposes.
          </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            With the increasing popularity of social media, e-commerce, and countless other services, the average person
            creates accounts on dozens of websites: a situation that can quickly become hard to keep track of. While existing
            tools like password managers solve the issue of storing these accounts, none are tailored to gaining an understanding
            of a user’s digital footprint. Our project seeks to provide users with a convenient account tracking solution
            and information security learning tool by automatically discovering and presenting a comprehensive view of their digital footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided use a "thick client", meaning that a large majority of the data processing happens on the user's computer.
            Our intention was to completely contain the user's data to their machine unless they opt to synchronize their data with our servers.
            A incredibly useful system combining <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> and <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>
            enables this. Essentially, everything that the user does is stored in the local PouchDB database. If the user enables syncing on our website,
            the local PouchDB replicates to the remote CouchDB. Then, if the user logs in on another device, all of their data will be available.
            All data is securely end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that your data is always safe from prying eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are some features available:
            <ul>
              <li>Automated username search with support for 300+ websites</li>
              <li>Add custom websites</li>
              <li>Profile page editor</li>
              <li>Public profile page</li>
              <li>Public profile page analytics</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, many websites disable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which is a huge part of our project. To remedy this issue,
            we developed a Chrome extension that intercepts each network request and acts like any other CORS-blocking extension, like
            <a href="https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html">this one</a>. It also acts like a password manager, detecting any
            credentials entered on the web page. If you have not added the current website to your TRACE data, it gives you the option to do so.
            There are also tabs available for generating secure passwords, testing your current passwords, and checking if your usernames or emails
            have been implicated in any data breach.

            Our browser extension is available on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trace/klhmocgplcpemcdfeefpaikihedmikgk">Chrome</a>
            and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/trace-digital/">Firefox</a> web stores.

    body: `<p>
            In an effort to move away from my Google-reliant digital life, and free myself from having to pay a yearly fee for storage, I decided
            to set up my own cloud storage system. Nextcloud is an open-source cloud storage system that you can host yourself. It is under very
            active development, and is estimated to have over 20 million users worldwide. I can access my instance from anywhere in the world, with
            all of the functionality of Google Drive. The obvious caveat of this solution is that you must manage it yourself. Google Drive is incredibly
            convenient - there are no worries of data loss, and <strong>it just works</strong>. Using Nextcloud, I've had to set up lots of functionality
            for myself. I currently use it for cloud storage, a TODO list (Nextcloud Tasks), Find My Phone (Nextcloud PhoneTrack), and video chatting (Nextcloud Talk). 
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this data is at risk of loss at any time, whether it be a fire, drive failure, power surge, or anything else. I've decided to practice
            the tried-and-true 3-2-1 system of backing up data. This states the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Keep 3 copies of your data</li>
              <li>Stored on 2 different media</li>
              <li>With 1 copy off-site for disaster recovery</li>
            </ul>
              Right now, I have my Nextcloud server running in my own home. Every 2 days, I send a zipped, encrypted copy of my data to my desktop computer, which
              retains the most recent 14 copies. I also send one to my <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> bucket storage, which retains
              the most recent 7 copies. Therefore, I have 3 copies (one production copy and 2 backup copies), stored on 2 different media
              (2 different physical hard drives), and one off-site disaster recovery copy (Backblaze). All of this is automated using bash scripts and cron jobs,
              so I don't have to worry about micro-managing everything. If I ever need to recover my data, I simply decrypt it with my passphrase and start the docker
              containers with the docker-compose files.
